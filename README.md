\# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning



\# Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  

The model classifies news as Real or Fake based on textual content.



\# Problem Statement

With the rise of social media, misinformation spreads rapidly. Manual verification is slow and unreliable.  

This project aims to automate fake news detection using ML.



\# Dataset

\- Labeled news dataset containing real and fake news articles

\- Text-based features extracted using NLP techniques



\# Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Scikit-learn

\- NLP (TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer)

\- Jupyter Notebook

\- Matplotlib



\# ML Models Used

\- Logistic Regression

\- Decision Tree Classifier

\- Gradient Boosting Classifier

\- Random Forest Classifier



\# Workflow

1\. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  

2\. Text Vectorization  

3\. Model Training  

4\. Model Evaluation  

5\. Prediction



\# Results

The model successfully classifies news articles with good accuracy and generalization.



\# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP can help fight misinformation effectively.
